### Provides 2 commands:
* `remove-empty-lines.inDocument`
* `remove-empty-lines.inSelection` - can be used without selection (will remove the current line if empty)

### Would be nice:

* Having an option to specify max number of allowed consecutive selections
* Having a way to remove multiple consecutive empty lines without selection (under the cursor)
